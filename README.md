# here is our final project pf course 15618@CMU.
# we have implemented a lock-free version of red-black tree acoording to the following paper
# Kim J H, Cameron H, Graham P. Lock-free red-black trees using cas

## Summary
We found that there are many flaws within this paper and the pseudocodes are inconsistent. We believe 
that's why there are no experiments in the paper (i.e., the authors didn't manage to implement it) and
why it is hard to implement, especially the MoveUpRule.

However, we managed to implement this algorithm with both insert and remove (linear speedup with multi-threads)
in branch `spacingAndMoveUp`. What's more, we found that the two rules proposed by the paper is unnecessary
that we introduced a much simpler marker mechanism in our report, which will avoid the `double marker problem`
and thus do not need the two rules. The implementation of the simplified version is in branch master.

## Run test demo
To run tests for lock-free (both insert and remove):

    1. go to the root folder of this repository
    2. run `python3 src/gen_data.py`, this will generate a `data.txt` containing 100,000 numbers
    3. if there's no dir called `build`, then `mkdir build`
    4. run `make`
    5. run `./test_parallel`, it will automatically run tests on both insert and remove functions
       in the case of {1,2,4,8,16} threads and sleeps {0, 0.000001, 0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001} seconds
       between every two operations to provide different contention scenario.
